C4::Bookseller::Contact - object class for contacts associated with vendors

=head1 SYNPOSIS

This class provides an object-oriented interface for handling vendor contacts.
It uses Class::Accessor to provide access to the following fields:

=item id

ID of the contact. This is not used initially, since contacts are actually
stored in the aqbooksellers table.

=item name

Contact name.

=item position

Contact's position.

=item phone

Contact's primary phone number.

=item altphone

Contact's alternate phone number.

=item fax

Contact's fax number.

=item email

Contact's e-mail address.

=item notes

Notes about contact.

=item rank

Ranking of the contact so that the contact can be given the correct
priority in display.

=item bookseller

ID of the bookseller the contact is associated with.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 get_from_bookseller

    my @contacts = @{C4::Bookseller::Contact->get_from_bookseller($booksellerid)};

Returns a reference to an array of C4::Bookseller::Contact objects for the
specified bookseller. This will always return at least one item, though that one
item may be an empty contact.

=cut

sub get_from_bookseller {
    my ($class, $bookseller) = @_;

    return unless $bookseller;

    my @contacts;
    my $query = "SELECT * FROM aqcontacts WHERE booksellerid = ?";
    my $dbh = C4::Context->dbh;
    my $sth = $dbh->prepare($query);
    $sth->execute($bookseller);
    while (my $rec = $sth->fetchrow_hashref()) {
        push @contacts, $class->new($rec);
    }

    push @contacts, $class->new() unless @contacts;

    return \@contacts;
}


=head2 fetch

    my $contact = C4::Bookseller::Contact->fetch($contactid);

Retrieves the specified contact from the database. Currently commented out
because there is no separate table from which contacts can be fetched.

    my ($class, $id) = @_;

    }
    my $self = $class->new($rec);
    bless $self, $class;
    return $self;
}

=head2 save

    $contact->save();

Save a contact to the database.
